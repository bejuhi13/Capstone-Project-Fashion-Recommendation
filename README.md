2023-2024 Capstone Project - FashionAI: Image-Based Clothing Detection and Shopping Recommendation

## Abstract
In todayâ€™s world, the retail fashion industry is going through radical transformations in terms of technology. The magnitude of options available on the internet makes it difficult to find suitable clothing items on online retail stores in an effective manner. To overcome this, we aimed to create a project that detects specific items of clothing from an image and makes realtime recommendations. We have developed a system which uses computer vision techniques to analyze images and recognize different types of clothing such as shirts, pants, dresses, etc. The system will then use machine learning algorithms to make product recommendations based on the similarity between the image uploaded by the user and products available on various e-commerce websites
